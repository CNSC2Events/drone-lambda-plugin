## What's New

> Thanks to [omerxx](https://github.com/omerxx)'s contribution about drone and Lambda .

* `region` supported
* `credential` fixed (and remove the deprecated AWS auth).
* `Go module` supported
* `Quick Fatal`: now plugin will be fatal if your setting is invalid or there is something wrong with Lambda.
